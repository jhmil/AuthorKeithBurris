        <h3 class="Book-Subtitle">Release Date: January 9, 2021</h3>
        <p>For six years, Scott Rogers and Alyx Hutchens served as capable, loyal soldiers of the Astral Empire. But in the midst of a seemingly pointless war, these close friends began to question their part in the army and their role in the killing of innocent civilians. After defying direct orders to kill a helpless civilian, General Orell declares both men treasonous and orders their fellow soldiers to kill them. Scott and Alex narrowly escape and become fugitives. But instead of hiding away, the men travel the world in an effort to gain enough support to challenge the country they fled in hopes of a better future. Against insurmountable odds and despite great danger, Scott and Alyx work together as a formidable duo to fight for their convictions.</p>

          <p>Ryan Singleton is sick of home—sick of his dad ragging on him and the dullness of closing his eyes at the end of the day, knowing he’s going to open them the next to the same monotonous thing. So he leaves home to become a bounty hunter. But that kind of life doesn’t come easy. He tears through one of the biggest zero gravity races in the area to secure the money he needs to start his future, and then nearly winds up dead on his first bounty. Luckily for him, a mysterious woman named Jody, an elite bounty hunter herself, comes to his rescue and dangles the future he dreams of right in front of him. All that stands in his way is Heydrich Kralick—a rival alien bounty hunter who hates him for besting him in that race. He’s ruthless, wanted by the law, and obsessed. Ryan stands to gain prestige, money, a world of passion and adventure. All he stands to lose is his life.</p>

          <p>In the wake of a world war's brutal end, the Astral Empire teeters on the edge of despair, its people living in constant fear under a tyrant's rule. But amidst the chaos, one man refuses to surrender to the aftermath. Lawrence Orell, the fiery son of the legendary General Orell, harbors an unquenchable thirst for vengeance against the merciless Emperor Alyx—the very man responsible for his father's demise.

            A formidable warrior in his own right, Lawrence knows that facing Alyx alone is a fool's errand. This cunning despot has already slain the previous emperor and seized control with an iron grip. Fueled by an unyielding determination, Lawrence sets forth on a treacherous odyssey, desperately seeking allies to aid him in his perilous quest.
            
            In a war-ravaged empire teeming with treacherous criminals and lurking abominations, Lawrence hardens his resolve. His mission: to infiltrate the heart of darkness, to end the emperor's reign of terror, and to restore the tarnished honor of his noble bloodline.
            
            Join Lawrence on an adrenaline-charged journey through a world shrouded in danger and deceit, where survival hangs by a thread, and the fate of an empire balances on the edge of a blade. Will he triumph against insurmountable odds, or will he become just another casualty in a merciless game of power?
            
            Prepare yourself for an epic tale of vengeance and redemption, where honor is tested, alliances are forged, and one man's unbreakable spirit threatens to shake the foundations of an empire.

          <p>In a world teetering on the edge of darkness, the Astral Empire's glory has faded, replaced by the haunting silence of regret and guilt. Years after Emperor Graves' fall, Emperor Joseph's feeble rule has left the realm vulnerable, and empowered monsters threaten to plunge it into chaos. Lawrence Orell, fueled by his father's sacrifice, vows to restore the empire to its former grandeur and seeks the one person who can change fate—Scott Rogers, a warrior burdened by guilt.

            Larry's quest introduces him to Maximillian Penmark, a thief seething with hatred against the empire, and the emergence of Damian Edwards, a necromancer with control over the dead. Rumors of Damian's twisted abilities draw Scott out of exile as he seeks to resurrect his friend, Alyx, but Damian's malevolent intentions shatter Scott's hopes in a heart-wrenching display of darkness.
            
            Alliances form, and loyalties are tested as the warriors of light and the acolyte of darkness must unite to confront Damian and his growing army of the undead. In a battle that transcends life and death, they must overcome their own demons to banish the encroaching darkness and shape the destiny of a realm struggling to find its light once more. Will they succeed, or will the undying reckoning consume them all?</p>

          <p>The hunt is far from over...

            Jody Winters has spent decades building her reputation as a fearless bounty hunter and the unshakable leader of her team. But time waits for no one, and Jody is starting to feel its weight. Her once razor-sharp reflexes are slower, her beauty is fading, and doubt begins to creep into her mind. Has her prime passed her by?
            
            When Eden Summers, a cunning rival who’s eluded her grasp for nearly twenty years, resurfaces, Jody faces the challenge of a lifetime. Eden’s return awakens memories of past failures and tests Jody’s resolve like never before. Can she summon the strength to confront her greatest adversary, or will this be the battle that finally breaks her?
            
            With her loyal team by her side—including the kindhearted Ryan Singleton, the ever-resourceful Katie Anderson, and occasional help from the enigmatic Earl Davenport—Jody must rely on her experience, instincts, and courage to bring Eden to justice. As the stakes rise and the lines between vengeance and justice blur, Jody is forced to confront not only her enemy but also her fears of growing older and losing the edge that made her a legend.
            
            Action-packed, emotionally gripping, and full of heart, Bounty Hunter: Heart of the Lioness is a thrilling journey into the soul of a hero.
            
            Can Jody prove to herself—and the galaxy—that the lioness still roars?</p>
